# Google Search Clone

**[LIVE PROJECT LINK](https://goggles-by-sarim.netlify.app/search)**

**Goggles** has the ability to search for up to the minute results, latest images, current live news and recent videos.

Built with **React JS** and **Tailwind CSS**, this **Completely Responsive Website** has a **Mordern UI**, **Dark Mode** and much more.

To get the results, I have used a _Goole Search API_

## Setup

Either download the zip file of the source code or clone the project,
then run

### `npm install && npm start`

You can find the API KEY on rapidapi.
